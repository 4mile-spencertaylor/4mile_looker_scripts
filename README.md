# looker_scripts
This is a repo for 4 Mile Analytics' team members to share knowledge and helpful scripts that can make our lives easier

#### Feel free to upload any scripts you've written or have found online that might be helpful. Please do not upload any files that have data or keys from clients (or our own instance, for that matter), as this is a public repo.


As an example, I've uploaded two python scripts that I've written to help hit the Looker API.
